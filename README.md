- 👋 Hi, I’m @JohnABye
- 👀 I’m interested in: software development, Microsoft / Apple / Samsung products, IoT, automotive industry, American football, 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning: C#/.NET software development, Kotlin (for Android development)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on: really interested in collaborating with a team to develop an application to interface with CANBUS system via mobile app (iPad on Dash for example). There are a few digital dashes on the market (Holley, Dakota Digital, etc.) - however, I'd like for this to be an all-in-one tuner, scanner, and customizable digital display - for the common enthusiast; with advanced options (fine tuning) available at premium tier, for those who would intend to use the software in a commercial capacity.
