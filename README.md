- 👋 Hi, I’m @JohnABye
- 👀 I’m interested in: Microsoft, Android, Apple, IoT (such as SmartThings), automotive industry and technology, American football, and serving others in any capacity. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning: C# and C++ design
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on: really interested in collaborating with a team to develop an application to interface with CANBUS system via mobile app (iPad on Dash for example). There are a few digital dashes on the market (Holley, Dakota Digital, etc.) - however, I'd like for this to be an all-in-one tuner, scanner, and customizable digital display - for the common enthusiast; with advanced options (fine tuning) available at premium tier, for those who would intend to use the software in a commercial capacity.
      I also have another similar project idea for an AI model that assists its users by providing a diagnosis, catered to all users, but with enthusiasts, shadetree mechanics, and those who must work on their own vehicles in mind. I don't want to get into the specific details here, but you could imagine how it might work, and I'm welcome to original ideas. Feel free to reach out to discuss.
