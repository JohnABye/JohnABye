- 👋 Hi, I’m @JohnABye
- 👀 I’m interested in: Microsoft, Android, Apple, IoT (such as SmartThings), automotive industry and technology, American football, and serving others in any capacity. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning: C# and C++ design
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on: really interested in collaborating with a team to develop an application to interface with CANBUS system via mobile app or factory Android Auto / Apple CarPlay interface. There are a few digital dashes on the market (Holley, Dakota Digital, etc.) - however, I'd like for this to be an all-in-one tuner, scanner, and customizable digital display - for the common enthusiast; with advanced options (fine tuning) available at premium tier, for those who would intend to use the software in a commercial capacity. A lot of us must do our own repairs, and this would make many peoples' lives better in that respect. This leads me to my next idea.
      I also have another similar project idea for an AI model that assists its users by providing a diagnosis, catered to all users, but with enthusiasts, shadetree mechanics, and those who must work on their own vehicles in mind. I don't want to get into the specific details here, but you could imagine how it might work, and I'm welcome to original ideas. Feel free to reach out to discuss.
      I have at least one other major idea that I would like to collaborate with a team on to produce an application - but do not wish to speak of it publicly. Please feel free to reach out if you have experience with building an app that requires user to manipulate 3D objects in space (such as home design software).
